# Jordonsborne.dev Porfolio Site

This is a porfolio website showcases my skills from the 9 years working with Eastman Chemical Company, as well as the personal development I have made in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This site is intended to replace the [JOsborne.dev](https://www.JOsborne.dev) HTML/CSS only site using the Next.JS platform.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
